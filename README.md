## Syncer Overview and System Architecture

The Syncer is a critical component designed to facilitate the migration and synchronization of data from Google Bigtable to Tencent Cloud Object Storage, ensuring that the Solana blockchain project is available on multiple infrastructures. The Syncer operates in two main modes: **ArchiveSync** and **LiveSync**.

### ArchiveSync
- **Purpose**: Handles the bulk migration of existing historical data from Google Bigtable to Tencent Cloud Object Storage.
- **Process**:
    - **Data Source**: The ArchiveSync process reads existing data stored in Google Bigtable.
    - **Conversion**: This data is converted into sequence files, a Hadoop-compatible format, enabling efficient storage and retrieval.
    - **Storage**: The converted sequence files are then uploaded to Tencent Cloud Object Storage.
    - **Execution**: This process runs on a Slurm cluster, allowing it to handle the massive scale of data efficiently.

### LiveSync
- **Purpose**: Continuously syncs real-time data generated by Solana nodes to Tencent Cloud Object Storage.
- **Process**:
    - **Data Source**: Live data is exposed from Solana nodes using the Geyser plugin, which stores data locally on the node’s hard disk.
    - **Conversion**: The Syncer reads the local files, converts them into sequence files, and prepares them for cloud storage.
    - **Storage**: The converted data is then uploaded to Tencent Cloud Object Storage in real-time.

### System Components and Interaction
1. **Bigtable Emulator**:
    - A local emulator for Google Bigtable, allowing developers to simulate Bigtable's environment without incurring costs. It is used during development to test interactions with Bigtable locally.

2. **HashBase Container**:
    - A local setup of HashBase, part of the Hadoop ecosystem, where data is imported from Tencent Cloud Object Storage for querying and analysis.

3. **Solana Bigtable HashBase Adapter**:
    - Acts as an intermediary interface, mimicking Google Bigtable’s API. This allows the Solana node to interact with HashBase as if it were Google Bigtable, enabling seamless data operations without modifying the node's logic.

4. **Solana Lite RPC**:
    - A lightweight RPC server used to query data from HashBase, providing a simplified interface for accessing the blockchain data stored in HashBase.

5. **Validator**:
    - A Solana test validator running locally. This component is crucial for simulating a Solana environment during testing, ensuring that the entire setup behaves as expected.

6. **Docker and Docker Compose**:
    - The entire system is containerized using Docker, with Docker Compose orchestrating the deployment and interaction between these services. Depending on the use case (e.g., using the Bigtable emulator or the HashBase adapter), configuration changes such as uncommenting specific lines in the Docker Compose file and adjusting environment variables are necessary.

### Usage Considerations
When setting up the Syncer, users must decide whether to operate in ArchiveSync or LiveSync mode, depending on whether they are dealing with historical or real-time data. Additionally, depending on the development or production environment, users may need to enable the Bigtable emulator or configure the Solana node to interact with the Solana Bigtable HashBase Adapter. Check `docker-compose.yml` for the necessary configurations.

### Configuration

The Syncer relies on a configuration file `config.properties` to manage settings such as BigTable connection details, local file directory to watch, COS credentials, and processing parameters. See the `config.properties` file for more details.

## How to run the Syncer
You can run the Syncer using existing scripts, either single instance or in a cluster using something like Slurm. For local development, you can check [Solana Test Setup](https://github.com/bwarelabs/solana-test-setup).
1. Set the proper configuration in `config.properties`, see the existing `config.properties` for reference.
2. Add the `service-account.json` file to the root directory. You should get this file from the Google Cloud Console.
3. Run either `run_syncer_bigtable.sh` or `run_syncer_local_files.sh` to start the Syncer service, depending on the data source you want to use.


## Environment Variables
This container uses the following environment variables:
1. **BIGTABLE_EMULATOR_HOST**: Points to the BigTable emulator service for integration.
